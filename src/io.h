/*!
 * @defgroup io Input/Output wrappers
 *
 * The io family of functions provide convenient wrappers around read(2).
 *
 * The io_read_eol() function reads bytes until the end of the line, that is 
 * until one of the characters \\r or \\n is found, and stores them in the
 * string pointed to by line.
 *
 * The io_read_eof() function reads bytes until the end of the file is reached
 * and stores them in the string pointed to by file.
 *
 * The io_read_len() function reads an exact number of bytes from the file and
 * stores them in the string pointed to by str.

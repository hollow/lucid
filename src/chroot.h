/*!
 * @defgroup chroot Secure chroot wrappers
 *
 * The chroot system call changes the root directory of the current process.
 * This directory will be used for pathnames beginning with /. The root
 * directory is inherited by all children of the current process.
 *
 * The chroot family of functions provide wrappers for other library functions
 * to happen in a chroot while the caller still remains in the old root after
 * the functions have returned.
 *
 * One can break out of the chroot in many ways due to the nature of the chroot
 * system call:
 *
 * - This call changes an ingredient in the pathname resolution process and does
 *   nothing else.
 * - This call does not change the current working directory.
 * - This call does not close open file descriptors.
 *
 * The main usage of these functions is to get a file descriptor, safe against
 * symlink attacks, reffering to a directory inside a new root.

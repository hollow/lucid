/*!
 * @mainpage The little swiss army knife
 *
 * The lucid library provides several convenient wrappers around system calls
 * and libc library functions.
 *
 * The size of functions range from a few hundred bytes to about 30K. Some
 * functions, including the printf, bitmap, and flist family are completely
 * self-contained and do not rely on libc. Others are just wrappers around
 * lib library functions to ease their usage.
 *
 * For a complete list of function families see the Modules page.

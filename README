The lucid library combines a lot of useful functions i wrote for my projects.
There are a lot of custom functions for strings, doubly-linked lists, bitmaps
and flag lists, input/output, cryptogrpahic digests, and tcp connections.

Some of these functions, especially string and list functions, are completely
self-contained and do not rely on libc. This makes integration in foreign
projects as easy as possible.

On the other hand, functions for input/output or chroot are just wrappers
around libc library functions, but may still be usefull to others as well.

The size of functions range from a few hundred bytes to about 30K. For details
please read the API documentation at

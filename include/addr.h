/*!
 * @defgroup addr Internet address conversion
 *
 * The addr_htos(), addr_hton(), addr_stoh() and addr_ntoh() functions convert
 * from host- to network-byteorder, and vice versa, respectively.
 *
 * The addr_from_str() function converts the Internet host address in standard
 * numbers-and-dots notation pointed to by the string str into binary data and
 * stores result in the ip/mask pair of pointers. addr_from_str() returns 0 if
 * no argument was converted, 1 if ip was converted, 2 for mask and 3 for both.
 *
 * The addr_to_str() function converts the Internet host address given in the
 * ip/mask pair of pointers to a string in standard numbers-and-dots notation.
 * The returned string is obtained by malloc and should be free(3)'d by the
 * caller.
